It is important to work with a registered dietitian to help you figure out a plan that will work for you a healthy meal plan, physical activity, and realistic goals will help you reach a healthy weight..There are many advantages to losing weight (and not just diabetes-related ones):.It is the amount of calories we eat that contributes to weight gain.Make small changes. Correct your portions so you are eating an amount that meets your needs but no more. Using a smaller plate helps you manage your portions while having a plate that looks full so you feel more satisfied. Also, avoid snacking. But when you are too hungry to wait for your next meal, stick to fresh fruit (for a sweet fix, or raw vegetables for satisfying crunch). This is a sure way to reduce the total amount of calories you consume each day, and the best method to avoid snacking on foods that offer only empty calories, and the likelihood of weight gain.Find cookbooks that show you how to make healthier recipes of your favorite dishes. For a little fun, take our carb counting quiz to see how well you know the carb content of certain foods; this can help you make healthier choices.Work with a registered dietitian who specializes in diabetes to help you set reasonable goals, and to develop an eating plan to works with you schedule and needs.Physical activity can help with weight loss, and in the article on exercising when you have type 2 diabetes, you can learn about how to start an exercise plan.", 'combination-medications-type-2-diabetes': '.Some medications combine the effects of two medications, and that has one main advantage.Many people with type 2 diabetes end up taking multiple prescriptions anyway, so it can be convenient to have them combined in one pill.', 'type-2-diabetes-prevention': ".You may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes.Even if you have several of the risk factors and even if you've been told you have pre-diabetes, you can take action and reduce your risk of developing diabetes.Don't delay:if you've been told that you're at risk of developing diabetes, get started as soon as possible.Your healthcare provider can help you develop a plan, but it should include:.Lifestyle changes are the best way to prevent type 2 diabetes, and if you've been told that you're at a higher risk for diabetes or that you already have pre-diabetes you should get started right away on your prevention plan.", 'type-1-diabetes-risk-factors': ".There are several risk factors that may make it more likely that you'll develop type 1 diabetes if you have the genetic marker that makes you susceptible to diabetes.That genetic marker is located on chromosome 6, and it's an HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex.Several HLA complexes have been connected to type 1 diabetes, and if you have one or more of those, you may develop type 1.(However, having the necessary HLA complex is not a guarantee that you will develop diabetes; in fact, less than 10% of people with the  right complex(es) actually develop type 1.).Other risk factors for type 1 diabetes include:.Viral infections:Researchers have found that certain viruses may trigger the development of type 1 diabetes by causing the immune system to turn against the body instead of helping it fight infection and sickness.Viruses that are believed to trigger type 1 include:German measles, coxsackie, and mumps.Race/ethnicity:Certain ethnicities have a higher rate of type 1 diabetes.In the United States, Caucasians seem to be more susceptible to type 1 than African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans.Chinese people have a lower risk of developing type 1, as do people in South America.Geography:It seems that people who live in northern climates are at a higher risk for developing type 1 diabetes.It's been suggested that people who live in northern countries are indoors more (especially in the winter), and that means that they're in closer proximity to each other potentially leading to more viral infections.\n\n\t\t\tConversely, people who live in southern climates such as South America are less likely to develop type 1.And along the same lines, researchers have noticed that more cases are diagnosed in the winter in northern countries; the diagnosis rate goes down in the summer.Family history:Since type 1 diabetes involves an inherited susceptibility to developing the disease, if a family member has (or had) type 1, you are at a higher risk.\n\n\t\t\tIf both parents have (or had) type 1, the likelihood of their child developing type 1 is higher than if just one parent has (or had) diabetes.Researchers have noticed that if the father has type 1, the risk of a child developing it as well is slightly higher than if the mother or sibling has type 1 diabetes.Early diet:Researchers have suggested a slightly higher rate of type 1 diabetes in children who were given cow's milk at a very young age.Other autoimmune conditions:As explained above, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition because it causes the body's immune system to turn against itself.There are other autoimmune conditions that may share a similar HLA complex, and therefore, having one of those disorders may make you more likely to develop type 1.\n\n\t\t\tOther autoimmune conditions that may increase your risk for type 1 include: Graves' disease, multiple sclerosis, and pernicious anemia.", 'type-1-diabetes-complications': ".Type 1 diabetes is complicated and if you don't manage it properly, there are complications, both short-term and long-term.

Staying fit and active throughout your life has many benefits, but the biggest one for people with diabetes is this: it helps you control diabetes and prevent long-term complications.Exercise makes it easier to control your blood glucose (blood sugar) level. Exercise benefits people with type 1 because it increases your insulin sensitivity. In other words, after exercise, your body doesn't need as much insulin to process carbohydrates.If your child has type 1 diabetes, making sure he or she gets enough exercise is not only a great way to help manage his or her diabetes but also instill healthy habits from an early age. To learn more about how to safely incorporate exercise into your child's routine, read our article about physical activity for children with type 1 diabetes.Exercise can also help people with type 1 diabetes avoid long-term complications, especially heart problems. As you can read about this in our article on type 1 diabetes complications, people with diabetes are susceptible to developing blocked arteries (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack. Exercise helps keep your heart healthy and strong. Plus, exercise helps you maintain good cholesterol and that helps you avoid arteriosclerosis.Additionally, there are all the traditional benefits of exercise:.One person who certainly understands the benefits of exercise in managing type 1 diabetes is Jay Cutler, quarterback for the Chicago Bears. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2008, but the disease hasn't interfered with his football career. To learn more, read our article about Jay Cutler's experience with type 1 diabetes.A Few Notes Before You Begin Exercising\n\tIf you don't currently exercise (or if your child isn't as active as he or she should be), talk to your doctor before starting. Especially if you're an adult with type 1 diabetes, you should have a full physical to make sure you're ready to be more active.Your doctor will be able to check your heart health, which is particularly important if you already have blocked arteries or high blood pressure. You also need to take into consideration any other diabetes-related complications retinopathy or neuropathy, for example. As you begin an exercise program, your doctor can help you figure out the best exercise program that allows you to get in shape but doesn't push your body too far.Before you begin exercising, you need to set realistic goals. If you haven't exercised much recently, you aren't going to jump into running a marathon. In fact, you aren't even going to jump into running a 5k.Allow yourself some time to build up to a steady, challenging exercise routine. It is okay to slowly increase your physical activity it's better for your body in the long run.Finally, talk to your doctor and/or Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) about adjusting your (or your child's) insulin around exercise. You don't want to become hypoglycemic during a work-out, so you'll need to do some planning.A Few Exercise Suggestions \n\tThere are three main kinds of exercise aerobic, strength training, and flexibility work. You should aim to have a good balance of all three.Aerobic Exercises\n\tAerobic exercises include:.You should aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week. In fact, the American Diabetes Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise a week, which works out to 30 minutes five days a week. If you think that you can't find 30 minutes, you can break up the exercise into chunks 10 minutes here and there.Also, stretch your creativity when it comes to fitting in exercise. Take a walk at lunch, or get the whole family out after dinner for a game of basketball.Strength Training \n\tStrength training gives you lean, efficient muscles, and it also helps you maintain strong, healthy bones.Weight training is one of the most used strength training techniques, although you can also use your own body weight to build up strength think of pull-ups and push-ups.When you're starting a weight training program, make sure you know how to use all the equipment. Ask the staff at your gym how you should properly use the weights, or consider getting a personal trainer to learn the best exercises for you.Lifting weights for 20-30 minutes two or three times a week is sufficient to get the full benefits of strength training.If you are unable to exercise in a gym, there are items at home that can be used as weights. Canned goods or even a 5 lb bag of flour can be used for strength training.Flexibility Training \n\tWith flexibility training, you'll improve how well your muscles and joints work. Stretching before and after exercise (especially after exercise) reduces muscle soreness and actually relaxes your muscles.Stick with Your Exercise Plan \n\tMake a commitment to exercise and make it a priority. Your long-term health depends on it, so as tough as it may be to find time or to motivate yourself to exercise, keep being active.One of the best ways to make sure you stick with an exercise plan is to mix it up and do things that you really enjoy. If there's a sport that you enjoy, try joining a league. If you like running, sign up for races to provide a challenge and a goal. Exercise with friends; knowing that someone else will be there with you makes it easier to want to exercise.Exercise and physical activity are necessary parts of your life when you have type 1 diabetes just like watching what you eat and taking insulin. Exercise can help you avoid serious long-term complications of diabetes.", 'type-1-diabetes-symptoms': '.Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, but the symptoms may seem to come on suddenly.If you notice that you or your child have several of the symptoms listed below, make an appointment to see the doctor.', 'type-2-diabetes-insulin': '.', '17821-endoscopic-surgery-shows-promise-lowering-glucose-levels': ".With commentary by lead study presenter Alan Cherrington, PhD, professor of medicine and molecular physiology and biophysics at Vanderbilt University.A new experimental procedure significantly improved blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. The minimally invasive endoscopic procedure resurfaces the uppermost part of the intestines, an area that some experts believe may become dysfunctional in diabetes patients.Results of a pilot study of the procedure were presented at the World Congress on Interventional Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes in London.It is well accepted that other types of gastric surgery, like gastric bypass surgery, not only help patients lose weight, but improves their glucose levels. Studies in the New England Journal of Medicine compared patients who were treated with medical interventions and surgery to those treated with just medications. More surgical patients achieved glucose control than medication patients. . There is little doubt at this point that manipulation of the gut can improve glucose metabolism, says Alan Cherrington, PhD, professor of medicine and molecular physiology and biophysics at Vanderbilt University, who presented the study.The question is why? The answer is not yet known, though there are several theories floating around. . One theory is that there's something in the first part of the intestine, right beyond the stomach, that becomes abnormal, probably as a reaction to food that's not good for you. The gut changes and starts to produce something that is bad for glucose metabolism, says Cherrington.The company Fractyl Laboratories developed a procedure called duodenal mucosal resurfacing, in which the damaged surface of the duodonem, that first part of the intestine, is sloughed off, allowing a healthy layer to regrow.In the study, 39 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes were treated. The goal of the study was to learn the best way to do the procedure and demonstrate its safety. In the procedure, under sedation, an endoscope is passed into the duodenum, and saline is injected under the mucosal layer to separate it from the muscle. The tissue is then destroyed, sloughing off in a few days. Patients reported little discomfort after the procedure and there were no serious adverse events. Following the procedure, the patients had a liquid diet for two weeks, and slowly worked their way up to solid food. They were told to go on alow-calorie diet, but there were no specific medication recommendations given.Though the study was not an efficacy trial, Cherrington, who is a paid consultant for Fractyl and owns some stock options, reported that patients who had a >9 cm ablation and who remained on their diabetes medications had an average improvement in their HbA1cof 1.4 percent at 6 months and saw a modest weight reduction of about five pounds. At 3 years, levels of HBA1c were 6% or less in 38% of patients in the gastric-bypass group compared with 5% of the patients in the medical-therapy group. Also, the use of glucose-lowering medications, including insulin, was lower in the surgical group than in the medical-therapy group.The next step is a controlled trial, which is underway in Europe. The pilot phase should be completed by the end of 2015, and the larger study the end of 2016.If it proves successful, the question is who would be a candidate for the surgery?.Currently bariatric surgery is reserved for the obese, but because this is much less invasive and more minimal procedure, it could potentially be used in a broader group of people.  You could argue that it could be useful for those who have really bad glucose control even on one or two medications, regardless of their weight, says Cherrington.It's still very preliminary, he says, and the key questions of durability how long it will last and how it works still need to be answered.1. www.wcitt2d.org/.2. www.diabetes.co.uk/results.asp?q=HbA1c&client=google-csbe&cx=000186758417407522161:b5hp6lp7xao&cof=FORID:11.3. www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1401329", 'treatment': ".Diabetes is a life-long condition that will require additional treatment and medicines over time, even if you work hard to control it. It is important to work closely with your healthcare professional to make sure you are taking the right medicines, eating the right types and amounts of foods, and being more active. .Older people with diabetes are at greater risk than younger people with diabetes for cardiovascular disease (heart attacks and stroke), depression, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), kidney disease, memory loss and dementia, and nerve pain. Talk to your healthcare professional if you are having any of these problems.Cardiovascular Disease\n\tThe risk for cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke) increases as we age but even more so in people with diabetes. In addition to trying to reach your target blood glucose level, it is also important to reach goals for blood pressure and cholesterol. There are a variety of ways to control your blood pressure and cholesterol using meal plan changes, exercise and medicines..Depression\n\tOlder people with diabetes are at increased risk for depression, but many people do not feel they need help for their depression. While managing diabetes (or any other chronic disease) is challenging, if you feel sad or hopeless for more than 2 weeks, talk to your doctor about treatment options. Depression can make it harder to manage diabetes and can make it hard to stay active and enjoy life. Talking to a therapist or counselor and possibly taking medications can help you feel better. Don't wait to get help.Hypoglycemia\n\tThe risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) increases as we age for a variety of reasons. One reason is that kidney function changes with age, putting older people at risk for hypoglycemia because the kidneys do not work as well removing the medicines used for diabetes, making them work longer. Another reason is that older people may have less of an appetite and skip meals or eat too little. Also, older people may not be aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as confusion, dizziness, hunger, blurred vision, and sweating. Some older people may need to take a lower dose of their diabetes medicine as they age, only if their healthcare professional recommends it. Thus, it is important to tell your doctor if you have any signs of hypoglycemia and what to do if you have these symptoms.In addition, it is important to tell your healthcare professional and pharmacist about any over-the-counter and prescription medicines that you are taking as some can interfere with your diabetes medications, causing hypoglycemia.Kidney Disease\n\tPeople with diabetes, especially older people, are at risk for kidney disease. Often, there are no symptoms of the disease or the symptoms are varied, making them hard to detect. It is important to see your healthcare professional regularly so that he or she can check your blood pressure, urine, and blood for signs of kidney disease. Controlling your blood pressure through meal plan changes, exercise and use of medicines is a good way to help prevent kidney disease. .Long-Term Care Options\n\tAs many as 70% of older people will need help taking care of themselves as they age. This can include help at home getting dressed, bathing, and feeding themselves, or living in a nursing home or assisted-living facility. Medicare and health insurance typically do not cover this type of care, so it is important to have a plan in place and talk to your family about it. Information on long-term care options is available at the National Clearinghouse for Long Term Care Information's Web site.Memory Problems\n\tOlder people with diabetes are at risk for memory loss and dementia. Tell your healthcare professional if you or your family and friends have noticed that you are having memory problems. All people with diabetes, but especially those with memory problems, need to make sure that they have reminder systems (alarms, pill boxes, notes, etc) in place so that they don't forget to take their medicine or take too much medication..Nerve Pain\n\tThe longer you have diabetes, the greater your risk for nerve damage (neuropathy). Nerve damage can happen in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy), causing pain, numbness, tingling or weakness. Nerve damage also can occur in the nerves that control organs in your body (autonomic neuropathy), causing bladder problems, erectile dysfunction, diarrhea, and stomach problems. Talk to your doctor if you have symptoms of these problems as there may be treatments that can help you.American Diabetes Association.

In fact, approximately 25% of adults over the age of 60 years have diabetes.Diabetes means that your blood glucose (sugar) level is too high. Your body's cells need glucose for energy. When you eat, your pancreas releases the hormone insulin, which helps the glucose from food get into your cells. People with diabetes do not make enough insulin or do not use insulin well, causing glucose to build up in their blood and not reach their cells. This can lead to complications including damage to the heart, eyes, kidneys, and feet.While type 1 diabetes is usually thought of as beginning in childhood and type 2 diabetes as a beginning in adulthood, it is becoming more clear that adults including older adults can develop new-onset type 1 diabetes and that children can develop type 2 diabetes. The different classifications of diabetes that may occur in older people are described below.Type 2 Diabetes\n\tPeople with type 2 diabetes do not make or use insulin well. This is the most common type of diabetes and typically occurs in people who are overweight and inactive. Other risk factors include a family history of the disease, older age, certain ethnicities (blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans), polycystic ovary syndrome, and a history of gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy).Type 1 Diabetes\n\tPeople with type 1 diabetes make little or no insulin and need to take insulin therapy as soon as they are diagnosed. Type 1 diabetes typically begins in childhood, but also may first begin in adulthood. This form is typically caused by an autoimmune disorder, meaning that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks cells that make insulin. In some people, type 1 diabetes may occur after a viral infection, such as cytomegalovirus, encephalitis, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, measles, mumps, polio, or rubella. In rare cases, type 1 diabetes may occur after injury to the pancreas from trauma or toxins.Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)\n\tThis is a subtype of type 1 diabetes that occurs in adulthood. Similar to type 1 diabetes, LADA is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks cells in that make insulin. In contrast to adults with type 2 diabetes, adults with LADA are often thin and may lack a family history of diabetes. People with LADA typically need to take insulin within 6 months of diagnosis.All forms of diabetes require careful treatment and management over a lifetime..American Diabetes Association.

We know that people who eat in the evening have a tendency to gain weight, which may be because of the natural rise in glucose that occurs throughout the day and is highest in the evening,2 says Dr. Jakubowicz, based on earlier research.  Since this scenario typically leads to a need for more insulin, which in turn prompts weight to climb, the result is a vicious cycle of more insulin and increasing weight.The good news, say these researchers, is that it matters very little what you eat if you are stuck in this cycle, and the way out may be to shift the timing of your meals so you\'re having a high energy breakfast and consuming most of your calories by about 3 pm. This is far different than the usual way most people eat having the biggest meal in the evening when the body is already winding down.2. This is a useful, non-pharmacologic treatment for anyone who requires insulin to manage their type 2 diabetes, she tells EndocrineWeb,  Focusing on your meal schedule with tight restrictions on time but not on the composition of your diet will reduce feelings of hunger, lessen your need for insulin, and eliminate carbohydrate cravings.Dr. Jakubowicz and her team studied 29 men and women, with an average age of 69 years, who had obesity and type 2 diabetes requiring insulin. Over three months, they were randomly assigned to follow a meal plan with the same number of calories (~1800 calories), but the timing varied:.Here\'s what might you expect by adopting a change in the way you time your meals to reflect an eating style similar to the Bdiet group:1. To reduce your need for insulin, improve your glucose control, and even see your weight drop, you will want to be prepared to make this an almost everyday routine, senior study author, Zohar Landau, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist at Wolfson Medical Center told EndocrineWeb,  and, by making this change, you will see a drop in your [insulin] medication, your body weight, and you will have better glucose control.A diet with the same level of calories but a change in meal timing and frequency has a pivotal role to help patients improve their type 2 diabetes, says Dr. Jakubowicz.Implementing a Meal Timing Diet for Type 2 Diabetes.From this study, while maintaining the same caloric intake, in this case 1600 calories a day, the differences for patients who consumed most of their calories earlier in the day was significant, says J. Michael Gonzalez-Campoy, MD, PhD, FACE, medical director and CEO of the Minnesota Center for Obesity, Metabolism and Endocrinology in Eagan, Minnesota."Clearly, there is a lesson here," Dr. Mike tells EndocrineWeb," For people with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is more to it than total daily caloric intake to optimize the meal plan. This is strong encouragement to do away with snacking, and to plan three good meals a day with the biggest one early in the day.".Now we need to understand why stacking most calories earlier in the day seems to make such as difference. "Why this observation holds true needs to be addressed," he says.The authors had no financial disclosures.', 'sulfonylureas-type-2-diabetes': '.Sulfonylureas were created in the late 1940s, and they were the first medication developed to treat diabetes.', 'type-2-diabetes-overview': ".Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more common than type 1 diabetes with about 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes having T2D. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report, 30.3 million Americans, or 9.4% of the US population have diabetes.1 More alarming, an estimated 84 million more American adults have prediabetes, which if not treated, will advance to diabetes within five years.1.There are several key differences between type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes.The most important difference involves the role of insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows your body to use sugar (glucose) from carbohydrates in the food that you eat for energy or to store for future use. Insulin helps keeps your blood sugar level from getting too high (hyperglycemia) or too low (hypoglycemia).People with type 1 diabetes are unable to produce any insulin at all. People with type 2 diabetes still produceinsulin, however, the cells in the muscles, liver and fat tissue are inefficient at absorbing the insulin and cannot regulate glucose well. As a result, the body tries to compensate by having the pancreas pump out more insulin. But the pancreas slowly loses the ability to produce enough insulin, and as a result, the cells don't get the energy they need to function properly.Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, meaning that the longer someone has it, the more  help they will need to manage blood glucose levels. This may require more medications and eventually, injected insulin could be needed.People with T2D produce insulin, but their bodies don't use it correctly; this is referred to as being insulin resistant. People with type 2 diabetes may also be unable to produce enough insulin to handle the glucose in their body. In these instances, insulin is needed to allow the glucose to travel from the bloodstream into our cells, where it's used to create energy.Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes because it was diagnosed mainly in adults who did not require insulin to manage their condition. However, because more children are starting to be diagnosed with T2D, and insulin is used more frequently to help manage type 2 diabetes, referring to the condition as  adult-onset or  non-insulin dependent is no longer accurate.Type 2 diabetes is usually associated with being overweight (BMI greater than 25), and is harder to control when food choices are not adjusted, and you get no physical activity. And while it's true that too much body fat and physical inactivity (being sedentary) does increase the likelihood of developing type 2, even people who are fit and trim can develop this type of diabetes.2,3.Being told that you have diabetes can be frightening.It is a chronic condition that you will need to deal with for the rest of your life, but it doesn't have to define your life.There are many sources for help at every step of the way, from initial diagnosis to living with the condition for decades.2,3.It is also important to stay updated about new diabetes treatment and new research. Because diabetes changes the longer you have it, staying open to learning along the way will make it easier to cope and manage for you and your family.Learn all you can about how best to manage your diabetes which you can do here on EndocrineWeb and be proactive in taking good care of you.", 'type-1-diabetes-insulin': ".This article will provide basic details on insulin treatment.You can also visit our Patients' Guide to Insulin for more details..", 'diagnosing-diabetes': '.In diagnosing diabetes, physicians primarily depend upon the results of specific glucose tests. However, test results are just part of the information that goes into the diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Doctors also take into account your physical exam, presence or absence of symptoms, and medical history.Some people who are significantly ill will have transient problems with elevated blood sugars, which will then return to normal after the illness has resolved. Also, some medications may alter your blood glucose levels (most commonly steroids and certain diuretics, such as water pills).The 2 main tests used to measure the presence of blood sugar problems are the direct measurement of glucose levels in the blood during an overnight fast and measurement of the body\'s ability to appropriately handle the excess sugar presented after drinking a high glucose drink.Fasting Blood Glucose (Blood Sugar) Level \n\tA value above 126 mg/dL on at least 2 occasions typically means a person has diabetes.The Oral Glucose Tolerance Test\n\tAn oral glucose tolerance test is one that can be performed in a doctor\'s office or a lab. The person being tested starts the test in a fasting state (having no food or drink except water for at least 10 hours but not greater than 16 hours).An initial blood sugar is drawn and then the person is given a "glucola" bottle with a high amount of sugar in it (75 grams of glucose or 100 grams for pregnant women). The person then has their blood tested again 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after drinking the high glucose drink.For the test to give reliable results, you must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). Also, you should be normally active (for example, not lying down or confined to a bed like a patient in a hospital), and you should not be taking any medicines that could affect your blood glucose. The morning of the test, you should not smoke or drink coffee. During the test, you need to lie or sit quietly.The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted by measuring blood glucose levels 5 times over a period of 3 hours. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels in the blood rise following drinking the glucose drink, but then they fall quickly back to normal (because insulin is produced in response to the glucose, and the insulin has a normal effect of lowing blood glucose).In a diabetic, glucose levels rise higher than normal after drinking the glucose drink and come down to normal levels much slower (insulin is either not produced, or it is produced but the cells of the body do not respond to it).As with fasting or random blood glucose tests, a markedly abnormal oral glucose tolerance test is diagnostic of diabetes.  However, blood glucose measurements during the oral glucose tolerance test can vary somewhat. For this reason, if the test shows that you have mildly elevated blood glucose levels, the doctor may run the test again to make sure the diagnosis is correct.Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:.', 'staying-healthy': ".Diabetes is often a life-long condition and requires careful treatment. By sticking to your meal plan changes, exercise, and medication plan, you can live a long and healthy life. To help older people with diabetes to stay health and active are the following tips.Eat Healthy\n\tAll people with diabetes should eat a healthy diet that is low in sugar (including sugar from fruit) and saturated fats. It may help to see a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) who is a diabetes educator to help you create a healthy meal plan. Medicare will cover the visits every year so you would not have to pay out of pocket for the visit..Stay Active\n\tAerobic exercise such as walking, swimming, and bicycling can help you control your glucose level, manage your weight, and stay strong. The American Diabetes Association recommends exercising 30 minutes each day, at least 5 days a week.You can split up the exercise into 10-minutes of activity 3 times a day. In addition, do strength training such as free weights, resistance bands, or yoga, at least 2 times per week. Strength training builds muscle and helps control glucose levels. Talk to your healthcare professional to see what exercises are right for you.Check Glucose Levels Regularly\n\tYour healthcare professional will tell you how and when to check your blood glucose level. In general, people taking insulin, those who are having a hard time controlling blood glucose levels, or have hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) need to monitor their blood glucose levels regularly.Older people with diabetes are at higher risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when taking diabetes medications, making it especially important to check your glucose levels. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include confusion, dizziness, hunger, and sweating.If you or a loved one with diabetes shows signs of hypoglycemia, eat 10-20 grams of sugar or carbohydrates (1/2 cup juice or soda, 4-5 crackers, 1 teaspoon of honey, or glucose tablets) and retest the blood glucose level after about 15 minutes and repeat these steps if the levels are still low. Seek medical attention if the blood glucose levels don't get better and tell your healthcare professional if you have hypoglycemia often.Never Miss a Dose of Medication\n\tIt is easy to forget if you have taken your diabetes medication. Luckily, there are a variety of ways to organize your medicines (such as a pill box) and alarms that you can use on your phone, computer, watch, clock, as a reminder to take your medication. You can also use a chart to check off when you take your medicine each day.In addition, if you have a smart phone or tablet computer, mobile prescription therapy products are available to help you manage diabetes. If your blood glucose level is too low, for example, the program will tell you how to treat the problem and will prompt you to recheck your blood glucose levels shortly after to make sure your blood glucose is at a safe level.Get Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels Checked Regularly\n\tTo reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke, talk to your healthcare professional about quitting smoking and controlling your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.Examine Your Feet Every Day\n\tMake sure to look at your feet every day for cuts or signs of infection. Use a mirror or ask a family member to help you if you have trouble seeing your feet. If you do see a cut or red patch that looks infected, call your healthcare professional immediately. Keep your feet clean, use lotion to avoid dryness, and wear comfortable shoes that will not cause blisters.Get Vaccinated \n\tIt is important to get the flu vaccine each fall and the pneumonia vaccine if you are over 65 years old or if you received a pneumonia vaccine before the age of 60. These vaccines are important for all older people, but are especially important for older people with diabetes who are at higher risk for complications from the flu.Hearing Tests\n\tHearing loss is common as we age, and is even more common among older adults with diabetes. Hearing loss slowly worsens over time, making it hard to realize when you are having hearing problems. If you have trouble hearing or your family and friends notice that you can't hear them talk or turn up the TV or radio loudly, talk to your healthcare professional about having your hearing tested.Visit Your Dentist\n\tPeople with diabetes are more likely to have dental problems and gum disease. Visit your dentist regularly and tell your dentist if your gums bleed or are red.National Institute on Aging.

It is important to follow your healthcare professional's instructions as long-standing uncontrolled diabetes can cause serious problems, including damage to your eyes, nerves, and kidneys. As you get older, your treatment may need to be changed, making it important to visit your healthcare professional regularly..Eat Healthier Foods\n\tAll people with diabetes should eat a healthy diet that is low in sugar (including sugar from fruit). Mono and polyunsaturated fats are recommended in moderation. Avoid or reduce unhealthy fats (eg, saturated, trans fat). It may help to see a diabetes educator or nutritionist to help you create a healthy meal plan.Mono and polyunsaturated fats are recommended in moderation..Get Regular Exercise\n\tExercise is an important part of diabetes management and can help you lose weight (if you need to), lower your blood glucose level, and improve your cholesterol level. The American Diabetes Association recommends 30 minutes of aerobic activity at least 5 days a week, and strength training at least 2 times per week. You can split up the exercise into 10-minute workouts 3 times a day.Examples of aerobic and strength-training exercises are shown in the Table. Always talk to your healthcare professional before starting a new exercise program to see if it is right for you..If you have trouble walking, chair exercise programs are available on DVD, online, or at local community centers or gyms.  Chair classes are even available on local PBS television stations.Work with Your Healthcare Provider to Find the Best Medicines\n\tTreatment depends on the type of diabetes that you have:.Oral Diabetes Medicines\n\tThe first oral medication that doctors typically prescribe for type 2 diabetes is called metformin, which helps the liver (our storage for glucose) from delivering too much into the bloodstream, helping to reduce blood glucose levels, especially overnight. Because diabetes is usually a progressive disease (meaning that it gets worse over time), your healthcare professional may need to add another diabetes medication or prescribe insulin to help you control your blood glucose levels. A variety of different types and brands of oral diabetes medicines are available and are used alone or in combination.Insulin Therapy\n\tIf your body no longer makes enough insulin or doesn't use it properly, you may need to take insulin that is made in a laboratory and mimic human insulin. Insulin therapy is injected under the skin is given with meals so that it can help your body process glucose in the foods you eat. The amount of insulin that you need depends on the foods you eat, when you eat, how much and when you exercise, and other factors.A variety of types of insulin are available and differ in how fast they work, when they peak (or reach their maximum effect), and how long they last. In addition, insulin can be given in a variety of ways including a needle and syringe, insulin pen, and insulin pump. Talk to your healthcare professional to see what type is best for you.It is best to inject the insulin in the same general area of the body (such as your abdomen, thigh, buttocks, or arm) to give consistent results. Insulin will enter your bloodstream fast when injected into the abdomen, slower when injected into the upper arm, and the slowest when injected into the thighs or buttocks. Be careful to not inject insulin near the same exact spot each time as hard lumps may develop under the skin. It is important to rotate sites from injection to injection to reduce the risk of lumps.Thus, it is important to understand how to use insulin therapy. Talk to your healthcare professional or a diabetes educator to make sure that you are using insulin therapy correctly.Never Miss a Dose\n\tFollow your healthcare professional's instructions carefully and never miss a dose of medication or insulin. It is easy to forget if you have taken your medication, so make sure that you have good reminder systems in place such as pill boxes, a written chart, and alarms on your phone, watch, or clock.American Diabetes Association.

This involves injecting insulin under the skin for it to work. Insulin cannot be taken as a pill because the digestive juices in the stomach would destroy the insulin before it could work. Scientists are looking for new ways to give insulin. But today, shots are the only method. There are, however, new methods to give the shots. Insulin pumps are now being widely used and many people are having great results.Working towards obtaining ideal body weight\n\tAn estimate of ideal body weight can be calculated using this formula:.For women:\n\t\tStart with 100 pounds for 5 feet tall. Add 5 pounds for every inch over 5 feet. If you are under 5 feet, subtract 5 pounds for each inch under 5 feet. This will give you your ideal weight.If you have a large frame, add 10%. If you have a small frame, subtract 10%. A good way to decide your frame size is to look at your wrist size compared to other women\'s.Example: A woman who is 5\' 4" tall and has a large frame\n\t\t\t100 pounds + 20 pounds (4 inches times 5 pounds per inch) = 120 pounds.\n\t\t\tAdd 10% for large frame (in this case 10% of 120 pounds is 12 pounds).\n\t\t\t120 pounds + 12 pounds = 132 pounds ideal body weight.For men:\n\t\tStart with 106 pounds for a height of 5 foot. Add 6 pounds for every inch above 5 foot.For a large frame, add 10%. For a small frame, subtract 10%. (See above for further details.).The Diabetic Diet\n\t\tDiet is very important in diabetes. There are differing philosophies on what is the best diet but below is a guideline with some general principles.Patients with type 1 diabetes should have a diet that has approximately 35 calories per kg of body weight per day (or 16 calories per pound of body weight per day). If you have a child who has type 1 diabetes, we encourage you to read our article about meal planning for children with type 1 diabetes.Patients with type 2 diabetes generally are put on a 1,500 to 1,800 calorie diet per day to promote weight loss and then the maintenance of ideal body weight. However, this may vary depending on the person\'s age, sex, activity level, current weight, and body style.More obese individuals may need more calories initially until their weight is less. This is because it takes more calories to maintain a larger body, and a 1,600 calorie diet for them may promote weight loss that is too fast to be healthy.Men have more muscle mass in general and therefore may require more calories. Muscle burns more calories per hour than fat. (Thus also one reason to regularly exercise and build up muscle!) Also, people whose activity level is low will have less daily caloric needs.Generally, carbohydrates should make up about 50% of the daily calories (with the accepted range 40% to 60%). In general, lower carbohydrate intake is associated with lower sugar levels in the blood.However, the benefits of this can be canceled out by the problems associated with a higher fat diet taken in to compensate for the lower amount of carbohydrates. This problem can be improved by substituting monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats.Most people with diabetes find that it is quite helpful to sit down with a dietitian or nutritionist for a consult about what is the best diet for them and how many daily calories they need. It is quite important for diabetics to understand the principles of carbohydrate counting and how to help control blood sugar levels through proper diet. Below are some general principles about the diabetic diet.Understanding Food Groups\n\tThere are 3 basic food groups: fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are the foods that can be broken down into sugar. It is essential to have all 3 food groups in your diet to have good nutrition.1. Why Count Carbohydrates?\n\tCarbohydrates make your blood glucose level go up. If you know how much carbohydrates you\'ve eaten, you have a good idea what your blood glucose level is going to do. The more carbohydrates you eat, the higher your blood sugar will go up.2. Which Foods Contain Carbohydrates?\n\tMost of the carbohydrate we eat comes from 3 food groups: starch, fruit, and milk.Vegetables also contain some carbohydrates, but foods in the meat and fat groups contain very little carbohydrates. Sugars may be added or may be naturally present (such as in fruits).The nutrient term for sugars can also be identified by looking for -ose at the end of a word ( ie, glucose, fructose, and sucrose are all sugars). Look for these on food labels to help identify foods that contain sugar.Below are some examples of carbohydrate grams for some common food items:.Food.Amount.Carb grams.Food.Amount.Carb grams.1 % fat milk.1 cup.12.yogurt fruited.1 cup.40.Bran Chex.2/3 cup.23.yogurt fruit.1 cup.19.Frosted Flakes.3/4 cup.26.Raisin Bran.3/4 cup.28.fruit juice.1/2 cup.15.bread/toast.1 slice.15.banana.1/2.15.sugar.1 tsp.4.pancake syrup.2 Tbsp.30.pancakes - 4.2.15.low-fat granola.1/2 cup.30.sugar-free syrup.2 Tbsp.4.To make things easy, many people begin carbohydrate counting by rounding the carbohydrate value of milk up to 15.In other words, one serving of starch, fruit, or milk contains 15 grams carbohydrate or one carbohydrate serving. Three servings of vegetables also contain 15 grams. Each meal and snack will contain a specific total number of grams of carbohydrate.For example: Each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories. A person with diabetes on a 1,600 calorie diet should get 50% of these calories from carbohydrates. This would be a total of 800 calories of carbohydrates (at 4 calories per gram) spread out over the day. At 15 grams per exchange, this would be about 13 exchanges of carbohydrates per day.The amount of food you eat is closely related to blood sugar control. If you eat more food than is recommended on your meal plan, your blood sugar goes up. Although foods containing carbohydrates (carbs) have the most impact on blood sugars, the calories from all foods will affect blood sugar.The only way you can tell if you are eating the right amount is to measure your foods carefully. Also, it is important to space your carbohydrates out throughout the day to avoid sugar "loading." Measuring your blood sugar regularly also provides important feedback on how high your sugar went based on what you ate and your level of activity.Where Do You Get Carbohydrate Information?\n\tThe "Nutrition Facts" label on most foods is the best way to get carbohydrate information, but not all foods have labels. Your local bookstore and library have books that list the carbohydrate in restaurant foods, fast foods, convenience foods and fresh foods. You will still need to weigh or measure the foods to know the amount of grams of carbohydrates present.How Do You Count Carbohydrates?\n\tCarbohydrates can be counted in number of grams or can be counted as exchanges. One carbohydrate exchange equals 15 grams of carbohydrates.Free Foods\n\tThese are foods that you can eat without counting. A free food or drink is one that contains less than 20 calories and 5 grams or less of carbohydrates per serving. If your serving of a food contains more than 5 grams of carbohydrates, you should count it in your meal plan.Examples of free foods:.You should spread out free foods throughout the day and not eat them in one sitting.Fitting Sugar in Your Meal Plan\n\tIt is commonly thought that people with diabetes should avoid all forms of sugar. Most people with diabetes can eat foods containing sugar as long as the total amount of carbohydrates (carbs) for that meal or snack is consistent.Many research studies have shown that meals which contain sugar do not make the blood sugar rise higher than meals of equal carbohydrate levels which do not contain sugar. However, if the sugar-containing meal contains more carbs, the blood sugar levels will go up.Can I Eat Cake and Not Worry About It?\n\tNo! A slice of white cake with chocolate icing (1/12 of a cake or 80 grams weight) will give you about 300 calories, 45 grams of carbs, and 12 grams of fat. That is 3 starch servings and over 2 fat servings.Before you have a slice of cake, ask yourself the following questions: Will that small piece of cake be satisfying or will I still be hungry? How will it fit into my meal plan? Do I have 300 calories to "spend" on this? Are there other choices I could make which would contribute less fat?.A 1/12 slice of angel food cake has less than 1 gram of fat and only 30 carbs. This may be a better choice.Controlling All Carbohydrates\n\tIt is important to realize that sugar is not the only carbohydrate that you have to "control." The body will convert all carbohydrates to glucose, so eating extra servings of rice, pasta, bread, fruit, or other carbohydrate foods will make the blood sugar rise.Just because something doesn\'t have sugar in it doesn\'t mean you can eat as much as you want. Your meal plan is designed so that the carbohydrate content of your meals remains as consistent as possible from day to day.A Word of Caution\n\tAlthough sugar does not cause the blood sugar to rise any higher than other carbohydrates, it should be eaten along with other healthy foods. If you choose to drink a 12-ounce can of a sugar-sweetened soft drink, that would use up about 45 grams of carba, and you wouldn\'t have gotten any nutrition (protein, vitamins, or minerals).

Hermida, PhD, director of the Bioengineering & Chronobiology Laboratory at University of Vigo, Spain.A pair of studies published last week in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, concluded that taking blood pressure medications at night reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 57%. Taking hypertension medications at bedtime, instead of upon awakening in the morning, improves sleep-time blood pressure, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and markedly reduces the risk of developing diabetes, said lead author of both studies, Ram\\u00f3n C. Hermida, PhD, director of the Bioengineering & Chronobiology Laboratory at University of Vigo, Spain.In their study of 2,656 men and women without type 2 diabetes (average age 50.6), researchers discovered that by the end of the 5.9 year median follow-up, 190 people developed type 2 diabetes. The most important predictor: high systolic blood pressure while patents were sleeping.And in their subsequent study of 2,012 hypertensive people without diabetes, the researchers found that subjects randomly assigned to take blood pressure medications at night not only had lower sleep-time systolic blood pressure, but were half as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those who took blood pressure medications in the morning (4.8% compared with 12.1%).Blood pressure normally decreases during the night by 10% or more. But in those with diabetes, blood pressure is more likely to remain high during sleep. This pattern, known as non-dipping, which can also occur in those with hypertension, is linked with glucose intolerance and other metabolic conditions. Growing evidence suggests that non-dippers face a variety of increased cardiovascular risks.Indeed, diabetes and hypertension often go hand in hand. Hypertension occurs in approximately 70% of people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and is about twice as common in those with diabetes as in those without. The two disorders have common etiologies and disease mechanisms including obesity, inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance.And while hypertension itself is considered a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, research has shown that some blood-pressure medications including diuretics and beta-blockers, especially when taken without other types of blood pressure drugs, may actually promote type 2 diabetes, especially in people who face an increased risk of the disorder."Diuretics, historically the first choice in treating hypertension and still the most cost-effective, have along with beta-blockers fallen out of favor," said Prakash Deedwania, M.D., professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco at Fresno. The drugs may increase the risk of diabetes in a couple of different ways: Higher doses of thiazide diuretics (i.e., \\u226525 mg/day) have been shown to worsen glycemic control, while even average doses of beta blockers can reduce insulin sensitivity. Evidence suggests, however, that these drugs work synergistically with other types of hypertension drugs including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, he said, which have been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes.Meanwhile, weight loss and regular physical activity remain the most effective ways to prevent and improve both hypertension and diabetes.  Physical activity and modest weight loss have been shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk by up to 58% in high-risk populations, according to a joint position statement issued by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Diabetes Association. Physical activity and structured exercise are both critically important for preventing type 2 diabetes, particularly among people who already have other chronic metabolic conditions like hypertension and insulin resistance, said Sheri Colberg-Ochs, PhD, lead author of the position statement and professor of exercise science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk.  Being active is one of the best ways to keep insulin working better.It is predicted that by 2025, 1.56 billion people worldwide will have hypertension and that by 2030 an estimated 366 million people will have diabetes. Of these, the vast majority will have type 2 insulin-resistant diabetes.1. http://www.diabetologia-journal.org/files/Hermida1.pdf.2. http://www.diabetologia-journal.org/files/Hermida2.pdf.3. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341857.4. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18513997.5. http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/5/1167.full', 'type-1-diabetes-overview': ".Type 1 diabetes is all about insulin a lack of the hormone insulin.If you have type 1 diabetes, then your body doesn't produce enough insulin to handle the glucose in your body.Glucose is a sugar that your body uses for instant energy, but in order for your body to use it properly, you have to have insulin.", '17894-skipping-breakfast-bad-idea-people-type-2-diabetes': '.With commentary by Daniela Jakubowicz, MD, professor, Diabetes Unit, E. Wolfson Medical Center, Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv Medical Center.Breakfast, often called the most important meal of the day, may be especially crucial if you have type 2 diabetes, new research suggests."It is quite remarkable that, in our study in type 2 diabetes individuals, the omission of breakfast was associated with a significant increase in all-day blood sugar spikes," says Daniela Jakubowicz, M.D., a professor in the diabetes unit at the E. Wolfson Medical Center, Tel Aviv University and Tel Aviv Medical Center.Skipping breakfast increased blood sugar levels after both lunch and dinner, she found. In the study, she evaluated 22 patients with type 2 diabetes who had been diagnosed about 8 years earlier. Their average age was about 57. Ten managed their condition with diet, and the other 12 controlled their blood sugar by both diet and metformin. Their average body mass index or BMI was 28, considered overweight but not obese.Evaluations were done on two different days. On one, the men and women ate lunch and dinner at specific times. On another day, they ate all three meals, again at specific times. The meals were the same milk, tuna, bread and a chocolate breakfast bar. The researchers measured blood sugar levels after meals.The rise in blood sugar levels was surprising, Dr. Jakubowicz says. The study is published in October in Diabetes Care and was published earlier online. "We found that participants experienced extraordinary glucose peaks of 268 mg/dl after lunch and 298 mg/dl after dinner on days they skipped breakfast," she says, "versus only 192 mg/dl, and 215 mg/dl after eating an identical lunch and dinner on days they ate breakfast." They measured after meals up to 3 hours after starting to eat. (According to the American Diabetes Association, those practicing tight control of their disease should aim for a blood sugar of less than 180 mg/dl 1-2 hours after eating.).Put another way, on a day when the men and women skipped breakfast, lunchtime blood sugar levels were 37 percent higher then on the day they ate breakfast and they were 27 percent higher at dinner time."This means that reducing the amount of starch and sugars in lunch and dinner [in attempts to better control blood sugar] will have no effect on reducing elevated glucose levels if diabetic individuals also skip breakfast," she says.Her bottom line? Even if you don\'t overeat at lunch and dinner after skipping breakfast, skipping the first meal of the day can cause \'\'major damage to the beta cell function.".While many researchers have studied the value of breakfast, this new study is valuable because if focused on those with diabetes, says Minisha Sood, MD, director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital, New York. She reviewed the findings. The new study also looks at the entire day and the effect of skipping breakfast, which gives a more realistic view of the impact, Dr. Sood says.She tells those with type 2 diabetes to eat breakfast and make it \'\'a balanced meal consisting of a reasonable ratio of lean protein, carbs and fat." For instance? Try an egg white frittata saut\\u00e9ed in extra virgin olive oil with vegetables and a slice of multigrain toast, she says.The new study findings may seem to conflict with other recent research finding that a fasting mimicking diet or FMD may slow aging and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including diabetes. In one study, those who followed the FMD reduced their fasting blood sugar by more than 11 percent.However, the fasting diet is not suggested for those on diabetes medications or on insulin. And that knocks out many people with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Sood says. "The vast majority are on medications," she said. "Probably 80 percent [are].".Bottom line, according to the author of the new research? "In light of our study, we highly recommend that those with type 2 diabetes not skip breakfast," Dr. Jakubowicz says, \'\'because it causes major damage to the beta cell function and leads to high sugar levels, even if they don\'t overeat at lunch and dinner.".http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/38/10/1820.full.pdf+html?sid=860338a6-3135-4cc4-a97f-79b3aa292367', 'type-2-diabetes-causes': ".Type 2 diabetes has several causes:genetics and lifestyle are the most important ones.A combination of these factors can cause insulin resistance, when your body doesn't use insulin as well as it should.Insulin resistance is the most common cause of type 2 diabetes.Genes do play a role in type 2 diabetes, but lifestyle choices are also important.You can, for example, have a genetic mutation that may make you susceptible to type 2, but if you take good care of your body, you may not develop diabetes.Say that two people have the same genetic mutation.One of them eats well, watches their cholesterol, and stays physically fit, and the other is overweight (BMI greater than 25) and inactive.The person who is overweight and inactive is much more likely to develop type 2 diabetes because certain lifestyle choices greatly influence how well your body uses insulin.", 'diabetes-related-foot-ankle-problems': ".What are some of the common types of foot problems you see in patients with diabetes?\n\tDr. Onosode:I tend to see underlying structural bony and soft tissue problems. These include digital contractures commonly known as hammertoe deformities. Another is hallus abducto valgus deformities commonly called bunions. A bunion affects shoe fit and comfort when walking, and causes soft tissue problems. Frankly, anything (eg, irritation) that causes bony or soft tissue enlargement of the front part of the foot (called the forefoot) can be problematic in the diabetic population..Is there a difference in the prevalence of foot and/or ankle problems in patients with Type 1 versus Type 2 diabetes?\nDr. Onosode: In my practice, patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) definitely tends to present more often than type 1 diabetes. I believe this is because patients with T2D are diagnosed later in life, tend to have more overweight, and more often develop complications by the time they come to see me. The onset of type 1 diabetes occurs in children and teenagers, who are usually diagnosed and followed much more closely so problems like ulcers and gout are more likely prevented but also identified early and treated.Do people with diabetes tend to have more foot problems than people who do not have the disease?\nDr. Onosode: People whose diabetes is not properly controlled tend to have more foot problems than nondiabetics. However, having diabetes is not a sure bet that a person will develop problems with the feet. I tell mypatients if you do all you need so your diabetes is well managed, check your feet daily, and see your doctor regularly whether that is your endocrinologist, primary care physician, or a podiatrist (foot and ankle specialist), you are more likely to avoid foot and ankle problems.Is age a factor among patients who have diabetes?\nDr. Onosode: Age is not necessarily a factor. The most important prognostic indicators are diet, exercise, and family history. We become especially concerned when the patient is very young, their diabetes is not controlled, and they have diabetic-related complications.What role does a patient's professional life or activities play in the development of diabetic-related foot and/or ankle problems?\nDr. Onosode: Lifestyle and physical activity plays an important role. The patient's profession can be an indicator to determine what their prognosis may be. For example, patients with sit down or stand up jobs. Here the amount of time spent on the feet is important. Patients who do not spend a lot of time on their feet tend to do better than the patient who spends 8 to 12 hours a day on their feet. The wrong kind of shoe and/or a shoe that does not appropriately accommodate the bony and soft tissues of the feet, can cause problems to develop.What types of diabetes-related complications do you see?\nDr. Onosode: In my practice, the types of diabetic foot and ankle problems seen are multifactorial. The most common complication is peripheral neuropathy, which I'll discuss next. However, we also see patients with diabetes who have foot and/or ankle deformities.Now you may wonder why a diabetic-related foot/ankle problem may progress to such a serious state. It is often because patients with long-standing diabetes, who have peripheral neuropathy, may not have adequate feeling in one or both feet or ankles, to know early that something is wrong.How does diabetes contribute to peripheral neuropathy?\nDr. Onosode: As physicians, we worry about peripheral neuropathy, which is an abnormal or lack of sensation in the foot or feet. When a healthy person steps on a nail causing a break in the skin, their body sends signals through the central nervous system (eg, pain, swelling). However, someone with peripheral neuropathy doesn't feel or sense those warning signals, and the wound may go untreated.I had a patient in my office who stepped on a nail more than a month prior. He didn't realize he had stepped on the nail, and he kept walking on the foot. Unfortunately, the small puncture wound became a full-fledged infected ulceration (see image below)..How does peripheral neuropathy develop?\nDr. Onosode: In my patient's case, peripheral neuropathy started as a burning and tingling sensation, which can be easily ignored. The problem progresses from burning and tingling and becomes numbness. When a lower extremity is numb, the person cannot feel microtrauma, and when left untreated, the sore(s) become ulcerated and infected.Please Note: If you have diabetes, please talk with your treating physician about a referral to a podiatrist.

Sleep quality improved and, for some, so did fasting blood sugar levels. The study was published October 12 in Annals of Internal Medicine.The researchers say it's the first long-term, real-world look at the effects and safety of moderate, regular alcohol consumption for type 2's, who are often advised to be wary of beer, wine and cocktailss. Study volunteers followed a conservative eating-and-drinking plan: A maximum of five ounces of red or white wine daily (a control group had mineral water instead), always with dinner. All were asked to also adopt a Mediterranean-style diet with more vegetable oils, vegetables, fish, nuts, whole grains and legumes (like red or black beans) and fewer sweets, trans fats, pasta and potatoes. .Drinks were on the house. Dry red or white wine from the Golan Heights Winery or mineral water from Mey Eden were provided by the research project to each volunteer. Empty bottles were collected and fresh bottles handed out at each check-up. This is definitely a cause for modest celebration, says Rachel Golan, RD, PhD, a researcher in public health at Ben-Gurion and one of the study's lead authors.  We know that excessive drinking is not recommended for anyone. But here we are talking about one drink a day and we found that it's not harmful for people with type 2 diabetes and may be beneficial. The calories added from this glass of wine are not much, but they should be taken into consideration \\u2013 and the benefits might be much more worthwhile than another slice of bread. We did ask participants to reduce about 100 calories towards the glass of wine.The study isn't an open invitation to an open bar for everyone, Golan adds. It looked at carefully chosen volunteers who were healthy and at low risk for over-indulging and other adverse effects. All were between the ages of 40 and 75 and, at the start of the study, consumed alcohol less than once a week. Their diabetes was well-controlled, they didn't smoke and had no family history of addiction, heart disease, stroke or, for women, breast cancer.  Only people with controlled diabetes should consider adding a glass of wine to their dinner.Those who have a difficult time sticking with just one drink and women with concerns about breast cancer should probably avoid initiatingthis custom, notes Golan.Wine drinkers were advised to gradually ramp up to five ounces a day (they used measuring cups) and told not to drive after their evening glass. They were also tested for genes that determine how fast their body breaks down alcohol \\u2013 a lab test that's not available to the public, Golan said.The results? On average, participants didn't gain weight, have wild blood-sugar swings or develop liver-function problems. Among the 73 red wine drinkers, HDLs increased 9.8% a rise of 3.5 to 4 points that could improve heart health. In some studies, every 1 point rise in HDLS reduced coronary heart disease risk by 2% for men and 3% for women. Levels of apolipoprotein A1 (a major constituent of HDL cholesterol) also increased. And levels of heart-threatening blood fats called triglycerides did not rise. That's significant, because triglycerides are often high in people with type 2, and alcohol can raise levels even higher.Fasting blood sugar levels dipped for red and white wine drinkers with a genetic mutation that made their bodies metabolize alcohol slowly, but not for the one in five who were  fast metabolizers with a genetic quirk that made their bodies break down the alcohol swiftly. Even so, the blood-sugar benefits were small and didn't affect medication use for the 75% of volunteers taking oral blood-sugar drugs or the 12% using insulin. Fast metabolizers did see blood pressure fall slightly. All three groups lost about three pounds per person. The researchers' conclusion:  These benefits should be weighed against potential risks when translated into clinical practice. When starting to drink, a person with diabetes type 2 should be aware of any changes in his or her blood sugar and act accordingly. But as we saw from our study, it did not interfere with glycemic control, Golan adds.According to Iris Shai, Rd, PhD, Professor of Nutrition and the Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases at Ben-Gurion University and another of the study's lead authors, wine's modest benefits likely came from two things: the ethanol in red and white wines and the beneficial polyphenols found in red wine.  The differences found between red and white wine were opposed to our original hypothesis that the beneficial effects of wine are mediated predominantly by the alcohol, she notes.  But the red wine had 7-fold higher levels of total phenols and 4 to 13-fold higher levels of the specific resveratrol group compounds than the white wine. The genetic interactions suggest that ethanol plays an important role in glucose metabolism, while red wine's effects additionally involve non-alcoholic constituents.Red wine polyphenols come from the grape skins that stay in the vat or tank during fermentation, explains endocrinologist R. Paul Robertson, MD, Principal Scientist of the Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research Institute and a professor of medicine and pharmacology at the University of Washington in Seattle.  It's not just the ethanol but also the antioxidant polyphenols that are beneficial, he says.  That's the whole point of the French Paradox. The antioxidants in red wine can help protect against heart disease. .While many medical centers discourage alcohol for people with diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association  most people with diabetes can have a moderate amount. The ADA recommends enjoying it the way people in the study did \\u2013 with a meal and in limited quantities (1 drink a day for women, up to two for men). Check your blood sugar before and for up to 24 hours afterward to see how alcohol is affecting you; it can cause low blood sugar.Dr. Robertson adds that stern cautions against alcohol use in diabetes  are more Puritanical than rational. There's nothing in the research literature to suggest that wine, in moderation, is bad for you   particularly for people with type 2 diabetes who are already at higher risk for heart disease. In a recent review of the research on red wine and health for people with diabetes, published in 2014 in the journal Diabetes, he notes that wine is associated with relaxation, reflection, celebration, conviviality, toasting, and a certain amount of dry humor and that  It may be that one significant mechanism of wine's beneficial effects is \\u2026relaxing with good friends during a savory meal with a great cabernet..ttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-blog/alcohol-and-diabetes/bgp-20056464.http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/drinking-alcohol.http://www.joslin.org/info/Diabetes_and_Alcohol.html.http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/79/1/8.abstract?ijkey=2ebc3f5084c5277b389c09aad8744ad832ff364e&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha.https://my.americanheart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_425988.pdf.http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/making-healthy-food-choices/alcohol.html#sthash.tccnX8gH.dpuf.http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/making-healthy-food-choices/alcohol.html.", 'type-2-diabetes-exercise': ".When you have type 2 diabetes, physical activity is an important component of your treatment plan. It's also important to have a healthy meal plan and maintain your blood glucose level through medications or insulin, if necessary.If you stay fit and active throughout your life, you'll be able to better control your diabetes and keep your blood glucose level in the correct range.Controlling your blood glucose level is essential to preventing long-term complications, such as nerve pain and kidney disease.Exercise has so many benefits, but the biggest one is that it makes it easier to control your blood glucose (blood sugar) level.People with type 2 diabetes have too much glucose in their blood, either because their body doesn't produce enough insulin to process it, or because their body doesn't use insulin properly (insulin resistant).In either case, exercise can reduce the glucose in your blood. Muscles can use glucose without insulin when you're exercising.In other words, it doesn't matter if you're insulin resistant or if you don't have enough insulin:when you exercise, your muscles get the glucose they need, and in turn, your blood glucose level goes down.If you're insulin resistant, exercise actually makes your insulin more effective.That is your insulin resistance goes down when you exercise, and your cells can use the glucose more effectively.Exercise can also help people with type 2 diabetes avoid long-term complications, especially heart problems.People with diabetes are susceptible to developing blocked arteries (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack.Exercise helps keep your heart healthy and strong.Plus, exercise helps you maintain good cholesterol and that helps you avoid arteriosclerosis..", 'diagnosis-treatment-diabetes-related-foot-ankle-problems': '.As a reconstructive surgeon, what types of foot disorders do you treat?\n\tDr. Onosode: I treat all types of foot and ankle disorders, including toe and forefoot deformities to large Charcot deformities. Diabetes is the number one cause of Charcot foot deformity in America, and is a major complication of diabetes.Charcot foot and/or ankle may develop as a result of peripheral neuropathy. The bones weaken and cause microfractures that can become large fractures leading to foot/ankle deformity. The bony displacement of small or large fractures erodes soft tissues leading to an open sore, ulceration, and infection. Left untreated, amputation may be necessary.What should a patient expect when they come to you with a diabetes-related foot (or ankle) problem?\nDr. Onosode: For patients with diabetes, I acquire an in-depth medical history and perform a comprehensive physical and neurological examination, including a CDFE a Complete Diabetic Foot Examination. The CDFE includes an orthopaedic, vascular, neurologic, and dermatologic examination.The examination includes a centralized monofilament test and tuning fork test to measure feeling from the knee to the toes; to make sure sensation is intact as compared to other extremities. Here, I am looking for signs of peripheral neuropathy..Typically, what types of treatments do you provide people with diabetic-foot problems?\nDr. Onosode: Non-operatively, the most important is counseling patients about diet and exercise. Controlling blood glucose is paramount. Patients receive counseling verbally and in written form to help them improve glucose management, and make necessary lifestyle, diet and exercise changes. People with diabetes need to wear the correct type of shoe for their foot type. I can help in this area too.On the surgical side of treatment, I want to make sure any bony or soft tissue abnormalities are corrected because these patients are at high risk for ulcerations, infections, and potential amputations. I can reconstruct the foot arch, toes, and foot and ankle bones to ensure there is adequate soft tissue coverage, and the feet and ankles are in proper alignment. These corrective measures help to reduce the risks for future problems.Is proper footwear a challenge for some patients with diabetes?\nDr. Onosode: Yes, even for my nondiabetic patients. It is critical patients know what their foot type is and choose shoes accordingly. The foot types are: high-arch (or cavus foot), neutral arch, and low-arch foot (or valgus foot).Shoe recommendations by foot type:.In shoe selection, I emphasize shoes with extra depth, a wide toe box, and arch support. It is extremely important for the pressure points of the feet and ankles to be off-loaded. An extra depth shoe with a heel cushion and wide toe box helps reduce pressure between the forefoot and toes. Arch supports reduce ground reaction forces and helps eliminate pressure points that can prevent skin breakdown, ulceration, and infection.Unfortunately, for the majority of people, insurance does not cover the cost of prescriptive strength accommodative shoes. Medicare may offer some coverage for patients who qualify.Please Note: If you have diabetes, please talk with your treating physician about a referral to a podiatrist.

Now, a new study suggests how crucial that step is. Italian researchers compared the effects of mixing or not mixing NPH insulin on the insulin concentrations in the blood."It is well known that NPH insulin needs resuspension prior to its use," says Geremia Brunetto Bolli, MD, professor of endocrinology at the Perugia University School of Medicine in Perugia, Italy, who led the study. "However, the different glucose lowering effect of re-suspended versus non-resuspended NPH was not known," he says.In his study, he found that non resuspended NPH insulin \'\'may result in an approximately twofold difference" in the effect on insulin levels in the blood. His study was published online Sept. 10 in Diabetes Care. So it is important that NPH is properly resuspended prior to its use, says Dr. Bolli.Other insulins that don\'t require mixing have often replaced NPH. Ideally "people with type 1 diabetes should not use NPH," he says, but be switched to newer types. "However, NPH is still used a lot in type 2 diabetes, either as NPH or mixed with rapid insulin," he says. Two common reasons people are still using NPH:  Limited health insurance coverage, or lack of insurance, says EndocrineWeb Advisory Board Member Amy Hess Fischl, MS, RD, LDN, BC-ADM, CDE, an advanced practice dietitian at the University of Chicago Kovler Diabetes Center. She adds that pre-mixed insulin is still quite popular in the type 2 population because it is a fixed 2 injections per day versus multiple daily injections that could be 4 or more injections per day.NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin, usually reaching the bloodstream 2 to 4 hours after injection, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) says, peaking 4 to 12 hour later. It is effective for about 12 to 18 hours, the ADA says. "If the patient is obliged to use NPH for some reason, they should strive to spend two minutes of their time prior to each injection to resuspend NPH," says Dr. Bolli. He reports receiving honoraria from sanofi-aventis and Eli Lilly & Co for consulting and scientific advising.Dr. Bolli evaluated 11 people with type 1 diabetes. He looked at the effects of mixing the insulin as instructed or not. When the insulin was not mixed, insulin blood levels were either reduced or increased. The duration of the effect also varied greatly, depending on whether or not it was mixed properly. For instance, when it was mixed property, the insulin action lasted for nearly 12 hours, but when it wasn\'t, it could last as briefly as about 9 hours.The study findings make good sense, according to Spyros Mezitis, MD, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, who says that this is not new information. "We already knew if you don\'t resuspend it [NPH] right, you aren\'t going to get as good a result," he says. But the new study adds some scientific support and hard numbers to what is common knowledge about the need to mix up the insulin before injecting.NPH insulin use is probably more common overseas, he says, but is still in use in the U.S. "If you don\'t turn it upside down, the insulin doesn\'t disperse equally," Dr. Mezitis says. And it doesn\'t work as well. "The blood sugar is not going to be controlled as well.".1. http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/07/dc15-0801.abstract.2. http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/insulin/insulin-basics.html.3. http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/suppl_1/s121.full', 'type-1-diabetes-facts-tips': '.', 'alpha-glucosidase-inhibitors-type-2-diabetes': '.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors block (or inhibit) your body from breaking down carbohydrates, which should reduce the amount of glucose in your blood.', '17413-diabetes-drug-empagliflozin-reduces-heart-disease-death': '.With commentary by senior study author Silvio Inzucchi, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Yale University Diabetes Center.A new glucose-lowering drug, empagliflozin (Jardiance), can not only help treat diabetes, but can protect against cardiovascular-related deaths, new research suggests.That is important, since those with type 2 diabetes are at much higher risk of cardiovascular disease. About two of every three people with type 2 diabetes die of heart disease or stroke, the American Diabetes Association says.In the new study, Jardiance helped prevent one in three cardiovascular-related deaths in patients with diabetes who had established heart disease, the researchers found. "We found that the risk for cardiovascular death was reduced by 38%, overall death [from any cause] by 32%, and hospitalization for heart failure by 35%,\'\' says Silvio Inzucchi, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Yale University Diabetes Center. He presented the findings at the meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Stockholm on September 17. The findings were also published Sept. 17 in the The New England Journal of Medicine."This is the first time that a diabetes drug has shown such a benefit in high-risk patients," Dr. Inzucchi says. "There were also no major safety signals [side effects] except for the known side effect of this class of increasing the risk of genital infections\\u2026\'\'.Empagliflozin, or Jardiance, is in a class known as a SGLT-2, a sodium glucose cotransporter-2. It was FDA-approved in 2014. It can be given as a solo treatment or in combination with other diabetes drugs. Other drugs in the SGLT-2 class include Invokana (canagliflozin) and Farxiga (dapagliflozin), sometimes combined with other drugs. The SGLT-2 drugs lower blood sugar by causing the kidney to remove sugar from the body and excrete it in urine.For the current study, the researchers assigned more than 7,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease, such as a heart attack, to one of three groups. One group took 10 milligrams of the drug a day, another took 25 milligrams. A third group took a placebo pill daily.The men and women were enrolled in the study from late 2010 through early 2013 and were followed for about three years.The researchers looked at rates of non-fatal heart attacks, non-fatal strokes and death from cardiovascular disease as a combined outcome. The researchers did not find substantial differences between groups in the rate of non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke, so the main \'\'driver\'\' of the risk reduction outcome was the reduction in death.Funding for the study was from the drug\'s makers, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly.In May, 2015, the FDA issued a safety communication on SGLT-2 inhibitors, warning that they may lead to too much acid in the blood, a serious condition called ketoacidosis, which may require hospitalization. In the new study, one patient in the placebo group developed the condition, and four in the drug-treated groups did.The study findings are called \'\'excellent news\'\' by Joel Zonszein, MD, director of the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Health System, the Bronx. He was not involved in the study but reviewed the findings.It is, he says, \'\'the first drug for diabetes that demonstrates cardiovascular disease superiority that is, a reduction in cardiovascular disease events." FDA draft guidance, issued in 2008, calls for new diabetes drugs to demonstrate cardiovascular safety. Other drugs, he says, have demonstrated neutrality that is, they don\'t increase cardiovascular risk but nor do they decrease it.The results were also noticed fairly quickly, Dr. Zonszein says. "Most of the studies we have with statins [and their effect on heart disease risks] show it takes about five years to see a significant change."."We are still not sure about the mechanism," says Dr. Inzucchi of the new drug\'s actions. However, he adds that \'\'there are many theories. One thing we can say is that this is probably not mediated through glucose control alone."."These are medications that work at the level of the kidney," Dr. Zonszein says. He calls it a water pill that causes loss of sugar, and that is part of the reason patients tend to lose excess weight on the drug, he says.Cost is sometimes a barrier, both doctors agree. Jardiance is about $4,000 a year if no health insurance coverage is available. "Cost is always an important issue, and I have been concerned about the increasing prices of diabetes drugs for several years," Dr. Inzucchi says.Some insurance companies are covering, says Dr. Zonszein, but the co-pays for patients may be higher for this than for some other drugs, he finds.Dr. Zonszein reports serving on the speakers\' bureau for Novo Nordisk and Takeda and is a consultant on an international level for Boehringer Ingelheim. Dr. Inzucchi reports consulting fees from Novo Nordisk and Intarcia and honoraria from other companies in such capacities and serving on the research program advisory board.1. http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/heart-disease/.2. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm446852.htm.3. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm446845.htm.4. http://www.goodrx.com/jardiance.5. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm071627.pdf', '59538-ketogenic-diet-is-it-good-for-diabetes-and-weight-loss': '.With Laura Saslow, PhD, Andrew Reynolds, PhD, J. Michael Gonzalez-Campoy, MD, PhD, and Joseph Galati, MD.Diets that promise successful weight loss get a lot of buzz. So it stands to reason that any diet that promises to reverse your diabetes, promote weight loss, and lower your blood sugar enough so you might get off your meds, is no doubt going to generate even more attention.That\'s certainly the case with the ketogenic diet a very low-carb meal plan based on the findings of two recently published studies.1,2 Dr.Saslow and her team report that the individuals with type 2 diabetes who followed the keto diet lost significantly more weight than those on the low-fat diet espoused by the American Diabetic Association.1These dieters also were able to get their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 6.5%, suggesting that some may have reversed their type 2 diabetes.1.In a second study,2 a Harvard-led research team evaluated the benefit of a ketogenic diet in both children and adults with type 1 diabetes despite concerns about a possible negative effect on growth and development in children following such a restricted diet.These researchers report "exceptional" glucose controlwith little adverse effects. However, the participants were recruited from a closed Facebook group, TypeOneGrit, for people who follow a diet and diabetes program based on the recommendations in the Diabetes Solution,3a book by Richard K Bernstein, MD, who devised this program tomanage his own type 1 diabetes.The ketogenic diet focuses on lean meat and lots of vegetables to promote weight loss.Too good to be true? Many experts are pushing back and raising questions about whether the keto diet itself is responsible for the improvement in weight and blood sugar or maybe the dieters\' successes are due to other components of the research methods, such as lifestyle differences or physiological changes."First, the studies are too small to make sense of the differences between the groups," says Michael J Gonzalez-Campoy, MD, PhD, medical director and CEO of the Minnesota Center for Obesity, Metabolism, and Endocrinology, in Eagan, Minnesota.And, it\'s important to recognize that both study teams acknowledge that as exciting as their findings seem,a large,randomized controlled trial is still needed to more closely assess a variety of components that may be contributing to the successes found in both studies before the findings can be recommended to anyone outside the study groups1,2he says."We recommend against \'dieting\',which is invariably a short-termsolution," Dr. Gonzalez-Campoy, tells EndocrineWeb, "and since weight loss may be accomplished by a reduction in calories by any means, a ketogenic diet that restricts carbs is simply shifting the calories away from foods that typically demand insulin as in both of these studies.1,2.Instead, the recommendations for diabetes and weight management, he says, are:.As both study groupsacknowledge, additionalresearch is needed to tease out any and all of the factors that may be producing the weight loss and decrease in HbA1c, says Dr. Gonzalez-Campoy, for example there may be other mechanisms of action that are helping these individuals to achieve weight loss, including changes in the gut microbiome, increased insulin sensitivity, enhanced leptin response, and decreased ghrelin levels, each of which contribute to weight loss.The study deficiencies reinforce the need to avoid encouraging the concept of a "diet" for long-term management of chronic diseases such as diabetes since there are many factors involved in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and parameters like serum glucose, HbA1c, and blood lipids, Dr. Gonzalez-Campoy says."If you follow the ketogenic diet, it\'s a very efficient way of losing weight and managing your blood glucose and getting off your glucose-lowering medicine," says Dr. Saslow, PhD, the study leader.The study was a follow-up to earlier research in which she and her team also found that those on the ketogenic diet lowered their HbA1c while those on the conventional low-fat diet did not.4 Just as in the current study, those on the low-carb keto diet also lost more weight.The more recent study was conducted online to ascertain if this online approach proved effective in eliciting weight loss.1 Dr. Saslow\'s team randomly assigned the 12 participants to the Keto diet and lifestyle improvement group and another 13 individuals to the traditional low-fat diet known as the Plate Method,1 supported by the American Diabetes Association.For the ketogenic eating plan, participants were instructed to reduce non-fiber-containing carbohydrates to between 20 and 50 grams a day, with no calorie restriction. The group following the plate method were told to eat their meals on a nine-inch plate, filling half of it with non-starchy vegetables (eg, greens, peppers, broccoli, carrots), \\u00bc of the plate with whole grains (eg, brown rice, sweet potatoes, whole wheat bread) and adding lean protein (eg, skinless chicken, turkey, fish, and seafood) to the last quarter of the plate.1.At the start, both groups averaged about 1,700 calories a day, and the average age of the participants was in their mid-50s. Some participants were on metformin to help manage their diabetes, and all had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes about five years ago.1.After 32 weeks, those in the keto diet group lowered their HbA1c more than those in the plate group with more than 50% achieving a reduction to less than 6.5%, basically reversing their diabetes. None in the plate group did this well. As for weight loss, those in the keto low-carb group lost on average of 28 pounds, while those in the plate group lost an average of 6.6 pounds.1.The low-carb diet induces \'\'nutritional ketosis," Dr. Saslow tells EndocrineWeb, which is not the same as ketoacidosis. Ketones are a chemical your body produces when you burn stored fat; if you are on a low-carb diet you may be \'\'in ketosis.\'\' Ketoacidosis is different; it is a life-threatening condition in which levels of ketones and blood sugar are dangerously high, which may occur in people who have poorly controlled diabetes.A total of 316 individuals from the TypeOneGrit community were included in the study since they met the three eligibility criteria: having type 1 diabetes, taking insulin, and followingthe Bernstein low carb diet for at least three months.2 The clinical data were gathered using an online survey and confirmed with data obtained from medical charts and feedback from the patients\' doctors; parents provided data for the participating child. The participants came from the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, of which 57i% were female, 42% were children (under 18 years), and 88% were Caucasian. 2.It\'s important to note that the drop-out rate was substantial and reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia 1-5 episodes) were experienced by 69% of those in the study.The mean carbohydrate intake was 35 grams (+/- 15) daily. Based on self-reported results, the change in HbA1c was -1.45% (+/- 1.04, P < 0.001) with an average HbA1c of 7.2% associated with greater hypoglycemia; yet, these results are comparable to other study findings. The average blood glucose levels were 104 mg/dL (+/- 16). 2 Final lipid profiles were mixed. The results were similar for adults and children.Experts Challenge the Authors\' Conclusions.The Keto diet versus Plate Method study triggered some challenges and a bit of criticism. In an editorial, Andrew Reynolds,PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Otago, New Zealand, suggests that the much better results in those on the ketogenic diet may be due not to the diet itself but to the lifestyle changes and ongoing support that keto diet group received.5.Those on the ketogenic plan received instructions on how to eat mindfully, the need for exercise and good sleep, and the importance of setting goals."It could have been a combination of all the support this group received that helped them achieve the greater weight loss," Dr. Reynolds tellsEndocrineWeb.Admittedly, the two groups were also very different, he says, and that also may have affected the results.5For example, those in the ketogenic diet group weighed, on average, 240 pounds at the start while those in the plate group averaged 198 pounds. Typically in research, the compared groups are more similar than occurred in this study, he says.Dr. Reynolds reviewed numerous research studies on ketogenic diets,6 and he has found that most studies show that the drop in blood sugar is typically short-term only lasting during the initial three months or so but does not last."So it is very hard to encourage ketogenic diets when we have no evidence that they work over longer periods of time," he tellsEndocrineWeb.Research is continuing. This was just a pilot study,1 Dr. Saslow says, so we could test the effects in a small group in order to see if working with patients online offered an effective way to have people follow a weight loss program. In her next study, she plans to break down the components of a program to determine which elements are responsible for the weight loss and the decrease in blood glucose and HbA1c."Those with type 1 diabetes should avoid a ketogenic diet," warns Joseph Galati, MD, a hepatologist at the Liver Specialists of Texas in Houston, "Many patients with type 1 diabetes have some degree of renal impairment, and handling the build-up of ketones and acids in the body may cause too much stress on the kidneys. Of course, any pregnant women with diabetes, especially those requiring insulin should avoid such an extreme diet given the low glucose levels will be a constant [health] threat.".As for individuals with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Galati says, "a very low carbohydrate diet could be tolerated, albeit with extreme caution. Transitioning to a ketogenic diet will require several lifestyle changes as well as careful monitoring of both your food intake and glucose levels and adjustments to your medications. Also, you should increase your water consumption.".For those who want to follow a ketogenic-type diet, Dr. Reynolds says it is important to first talk to your doctor and to discuss your goals so you can be sure that this approach is suitable for you given your medical and health history. Ongoing monitoring is needed if you do decide to adopt this very carb approach to eating. Seeing your doctor regularly is important to make sure that your blood pressure, lipids, blood sugar, mood, and medications are within normal ranges as you lose weight. Adjustments are likely going to be necessary from time to time..Financial disclosures: There were no conflicts of interest reported except for DrBernstein who has received royalties for books on the management of diabetes (which were used by members ofthe online social media group surveyed in this study).Dr.Hallberg who holds stock options and receives research support fromVirtaHealth, and consulting fees from Atkins.Dr.Rhodes is the site principal investigator in clinical trials for pediatric type 2 diabetes that are sponsored by Merck and AstraZeneca.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can be deadly, says Amy Hess-Fischl, MS, RD, LDN, BC-ADM, CDE, an advanced practice dietitian at the University of Chicago Kovler Diabetes Center and a member of EndocrineWeb\'s advisory board.  DKA is usually more of a concern for people with type 1 diabetes, but this warning is for people with type 2 diabetes who are taking the SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as people with type 1 diabetes who take these medications off label.DKA   dangerously high acid levels in the bloodstream   happens when your body breaks down fat instead of glucose for energy, releasing acidic compounds called ketones. Early symptoms include thirst, frequent urination and sweet, fruity breath, Hess-Fischl says. You may feel tired and confused, and develop nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and difficulty breathing.  If you notice symptoms, call your doctor immediately. But if you\'re vomiting, can\'t catch your breath or are concerned, go to the emergency room, she says.The FDA warning, released on May 15, 2015, is based on 20 reports of people with diabetes treated in emergency rooms or hospitalized between March 2013 and June 2014 for ketoacidosis. All had been taking SGLT2 inhibitors for an average of two weeks. In some of the reports made to the FDA\'s Adverse Events Reporting System, ketoacidosis may have been triggered by an illness (such as an infection), a drop in food or water intake or a reduced insulin dose. It\'s important to note that the FDA, as yet, is not directly linking these drugs as the cause of ketoacidosis or DKA in these patients. The agency is saying \\u2018we have these reports and we\'re looking into it\' be cautious. However, do not stop them unless advised by your doctor, says Yehuda Handelsman, MD, FACP, FACE, FNLA, an endocrinologist in private practice in Tarzana, CA, medical director and principal investigator of the Metabolic Institute of America and president of the American College of Endocrinology.  Dehydration, infection, severe illnesses, not eating, a high-protein and high-fat diet, or taking less insulin can, on their own, cause ketosis. It\'s not clear yet if the drugs played a role. We need more details about these cases before we rush to judgment.". It\'s important to note that the FDA, as yet, is not directly linking these drugs as the cause of ketoacidosis or DKA in these patients says Yehuda Handelsman, MD, FACP, president of the American College of Endocrinology. .SGLT2 inhibitors are effective drugs that help control blood sugar without causing weight gain (they may actually help with weight loss) or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), he says.  People who take them should be sure to drink plenty of water, be careful with extremely low-carbohydrate diets and if also taking insulin, be cautious about lowering the dose, Dr. Handelsman adds.SGLT2 inhibitors work in the proximal tubules of the kidney just beyond nephrons   the tiny filters within the kidneys   where they block the reabsorption of glucose back into the blood system. As a result these drugs reduce blood sugar levels and make the glucose stay in urine. In the process, they can also act as diuretics \\u2013 both by allowing more fluid out with the extra glucose as well as by also secreting excess sodium into urine.  It is important to maintain a state of hydration given the mechanismof action of these drugs, says Foiqa Chaudhry, MD, an endocrinology fellow at the University of Florida.  I think it would be reasonable to counsel patients tomaintain adequate fluid intake. It is sometimesdifficult to identify signs of dehydration. .A relatively new class of diabetes drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors received FDA approval in 2013 and 2014 for type 2 diabetes. They are not approved for type 1 diabetes (studies are underway) but diabetes experts contacted by EndocrineWeb say the drugs are frequently prescribed off-label for type 1 diabetes.  I would caution people not to go off-label, Dr. Handelsman says.  It\'s tempting to think you can lower your insulin dose because you\'ve got this pill but that may be dangerous. It\'s probably smarter to wait for the results of the on-going trials or find a way to join a study.At the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 24th Annual Scientific and Clinical Conference, May 2015, researchers presented data regarding suspected DKA in two people taking SGLT2 inhibitors. While the case studies were covered in the media, the connection isn\'t clear, says Dr. Handelsman. In one, a vaginal infection treated with antibiotics may have triggered the problem. And both patients may have had undiagnosed type 1 diabetes.  It is important to note that DKA develops only when there is a lack of insulin or when insulin does not function, he says.  I urge all patients to not stop their current medications and to first consult with their physician as necessary..1. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm446845.htm.2.

Insulin resistance increases the risk for prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and a host of other serious health problems, including heart attacks, strokes2and cancer.3.What is Insulin Resistance? .Insulin resistance is when cells in your muscles, body fat and liver start resisting or ignoring the signal that the hormone insulin is trying to send out which is to grab glucose out of the bloodstream and put it into our cells. Glucose, also known as blood sugar, is the body's main source of fuel. We get glucose from grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and drinks that bring break down into carbohydrates.How Insulin Resistance Develops.While genetics, aging and ethnicity play roles in developing insulin sensitivity, the driving forces behind insulin resistance include excess body weight, too much belly fat, a lack of exercise, smoking, and even skimping on sleep.4.As insulin resistance develops, your body fights back by producing more insulin. Over months and years, the beta cells in your pancreas that are working so hard to make insulin get worn out and can no longer keep pace with the demand for more and more insulin. Then \\u2013 years after insulin resistance silently began \\u2013 your blood sugar may begin to rise and you may develop prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. You may also develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a growing problem associated with insulin resistance that boosts your risk for liver damage and heart disease.5.Signs and Symptoms of Insulin Resistance.Insulin resistance is usually triggered by a combination of factors linked to weight, age, genetics, being sedentary and smoking.- A large waist. Experts say the best way to tell whether you're at risk for insulin resistance involves a tape measure and moment of truth in front of the bathroom mirror. A waist that measures 35 inches or more for women, 40 or more for men (31.5 inches for women and 35.5 inches for men if you're of Southeast Asian, Chinese or Japanese descent)6increases the odds of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which is also linked to insulin resistance.- You have additional signs of metabolic syndrome. According to the National Institutes of Health,7in addition to a large waist, if you have three or more of the following, you likely have metabolic syndrome, which creates insulin resistance.- You develop dark skin patches. If insulin resistance is severe, you may have visible skin changes. These include patches of darkened skin on the back of your neck or on your elbows, knees, knuckles or armpits. This discoloration is called acanthosis nigricans.8.Health Conditions Related to Insulin Resistance.An estimated 87 million American adults have prediabetes; 30-50% will go on to develop full-blown type 2 diabetes. In addition, up to 80% of people with type 2 diabetes have NAFLD.9But those aren't the only threats posed by insulin resistance.Thanks to years of high insulin levels followed by an onslaught of cell-damaging high blood sugar, people with insulin resistance, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance doubles your risk for heart attack and stroke \\u2013 and triples the odds that your heart attack or \\u2018brain attack' will be deadly, according to the International Diabetes Federation.10.Meanwhile, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are also linked with higher risk for cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, cervix, pancreas, prostate and uterus.11, 12 The connection: High insulin levels early in insulin resistance seem to fuel the growth of tumors and to suppress the body's ability to protect itself by killing off malignant cells. 13.How You Can Prevent or Reverse Insulin Resistance.Losing weight, getting regular exercise and not skimping on sleep can all help improve your insulin sensitivity. Don't rely on dieting or exercise alone: in one fascinating University of New Mexico School of Medicine study, published in the International Journal of Obesity, overweight people who lost 10% of their weight through diet plus exercise saw insulin sensitivity improve by an impressive 80%. Those who lost the same amount of weight through diet alone got a 38% increase. And those who simply got more exercise, but didn't lose much weight, saw almost no shift in their level of insulin resistance.14.Turn in on time, too. In a study presented at the 2015 meeting of the Obesity Society, researchers found that just one night of sleep deprivation boosted insulin resistance as much as eating high-fat foods for six months.15.1.
